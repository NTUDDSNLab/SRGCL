# Description:
#   This script searches for and deletes all "processed" subdirectories
#   under a given top-level "dataset" directory (including subdirectories).
#
# Usage:
#   ./delete_processed_folders.sh <dataset_path> [-d]
#
# Arguments:
#   <dataset_path> : The root directory where the script starts searching.
#   -d             : (Optional) If specified, actually deletes the folders.
#                    Without this flag, the script only previews what will be deleted.
